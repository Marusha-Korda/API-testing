# API-testing
This repository was created to show my practice skills in using Postman and testing REST API.

### Collection contains:
1. POST, GET, DELETE requests;
2. Creating collection variables using json response data and their use in subsequent requests;
3. Created test scripts:
   - status codes,
   - response text data,
   - JSON value check,
   - validation of correct input metrics.
 4. Using random data in the body of the request.
